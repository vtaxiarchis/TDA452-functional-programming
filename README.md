Labs for "TDA452 - Functional Programming" course

### Lab assignment 1: the power function ###

In this lab assignment, we implemented the well-known "power" function in two different new ways. The power function takes two arguments n and k and computes n^k (works only for non-negative k).

### Lab Assignment 2: BlackJack ###

In this lab assignment, we implemented a Haskell program for playing a card game called BlackJack.
